# Programming

Programming is by far the easiest challenges in the competition. This is due to its straight forward nature and lack of imagination \(although there can be some pretty uniques solutions\). I had a lot of fun with them but issues with the judge and the like really messed with me a lot. I used python for all the challenges.
