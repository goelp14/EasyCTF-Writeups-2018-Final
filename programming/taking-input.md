# Taking Input

By PGODULTIMATE

```
OK, OK, you got Hello, world down, but can you greet specific people?

You'll be given the input of a certain name. Please greet that person using the same format. For example, if the given input is Michael, print Hello, Michael!.

For Python, consider the input() function.
For Java, consider System.in.
For C, consider including stdio.h and reading input using read.
For C++, consider including iostream and reading input using c in.
```

I used python for this too.
