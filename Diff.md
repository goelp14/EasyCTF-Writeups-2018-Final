# Diff
### By PGODULTIMATE

```
Sometimes, the differences matter. Especially between the files in this archive.

Hint: This is a TAR archive file. You can extract the files inside this tar by navigating to the directory where you downloaded it and running tar xf file.tar! If you don't have tar on your personal computer, you could try doing it from the Shell server. Once you extract the files, try comparing the hex encodings of the files against the first file.

Hint: Check the man page for diff by typing "man diff".
```

So the first thing I did was obviously download the files. There were four files and it was pretty clear that I would have to find the difference between them. Unfortunately there were exec files so I wasn't so sure how to approach that initially. After some thinking I thought that hexdumping it should at least give me something - and it did. However, I realized that it would take me way too long to figure out. I knew there had to be a way to do this pretty quickly so I continued my research. I eventually found [this website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12118403/how-to-compare-binary-files-to-check-if-they-are-the-same) on Stack Overflow. The one that talked about **vbindiff** stuck out to me the most so I decided to try that. In terminal I typed:

```
$ brew install vbindiff
```

This installed vbindiff (I use a macbook). Then I actually used it:

```
$ vbindiff path/to/file /path/to/file2 
```

This gave me a really nice side by side comparison of the two files while highlighting the differences.
